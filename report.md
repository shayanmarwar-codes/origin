During this lab, I learned how to set up a development environment with VS Code and Git.  
I practiced creating files, committing changes, and pushing them to GitHub.  
I also explored working with branches by creating an experimental branch and merging it back into the main branch.  
This experience helped me understand version control and how to manage multiple changes safely.  
I feel more confident in using Git for my future projects.
